# Hello, this is Iarek ðŸ‘‹

I'm a curious and passionate software engineer.

I work with C#/.NET day-to-day, and have been working in this tech stack for over 13 years. I started my career in 2010 while still an undergraduate student.

I was lucky that I could start programming early in school (who remembers [Atari BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_BASIC)?). After that I moved onto Turbo Pascal and Delphi â€“ that was the primary language for all my schoolwork and coding competitions. Another thing to be grateful for: I had a very supportive programming teacher who encouraged me to enter the inter-school programming competitions. And then in the university I discovered C#.

Beyond the C#/.NET stack (now adding F# to the mix), I have been learning [Elixir]([https://elixir-lang.org) in my free time. You can see the results of my experimentation in my [Github profile](https://github.com/iarekk).

I've always enjoyed working on complex, distributed software systems, and I absolutely love functional programming (as long as it's the best tool for the given job).
