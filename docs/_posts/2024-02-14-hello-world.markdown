So, hosting a Jekyll website in Github pages isn't that much work. Overall, installing and configuring Ruby on my Mac was the biggest pain.

Big pros of Github pages and Jekyll stack:

- posts are written in Markdown
- once you have a custom domain, Github provides an SSL certificate for free (10$ saved!)

Things to figure out:

- [ ] Site analytics, page view counts
- [ ] To `www.` or no to `www.` (at the moment the redirects are set to redirect the `www` prefix to root)
- [ ] Find a shiny theme!
